# Little Steam games dashboard
Hello everyone, I present a little dashboard for Steam Store Games (Clean dataset) from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games). Gathered around May 2019, it contains most games on the store released prior to that date.

The project is executed using the Python. The library Dash was used to create dashboard. The library Plotly was used to create graphs. For work with datasets I was used Pandas (unexpected, right?).

How it looks
